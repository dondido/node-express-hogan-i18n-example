Nowadays we live in a globalised world where companies deal with customers, suppliers and other businesses irrespective of their country. Globalisation has brought with it a mingling of audiences with various mother tongues, and this is something to take into consideration when building a website and trying to target specific language group. This example features multilingual website with Hopan template engine and i18n translation module boilerplate which can be a valuable resource for building fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.\n\n
In order to focus on delivering content in the most effective way, this example uses progressive enhancement technique. Content is created first and other layers of enhancements are layered on top of the website. Each layer of coding placed on top of the content is optional. If the enhancement is capable of being displayed by the browser, it will be displayed. If the enhancement cannot be displayed by the browser, the enhancement will not be displayed, but the user's ability to consume the content will not be hindered. This means that the website continues to work properly even when Javascript is disabled or CSS not supported.
